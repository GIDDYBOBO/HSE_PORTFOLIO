    abstract: "This paper critically examines the environmental and public health ramifications associated with unscientific municipal and industrial landfill management. It investigates the dynamics of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions—predominantly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2)—alongside subterranean aquifer contamination via toxic leachate migration. The research demonstrates how engineered containment, coupled with landfill-gas-to-energy (LFGTE) capture, transforms hazardous waste sinks into sustainable regional energy assets.",
